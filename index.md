The Natural Language Processing (NLP) group at <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a> conducts research on core NLP problems, computational linguistics, text mining, and visual text analytics. 
We focus on the following research areas in particular (but not limited to):

__Discourse and Summarization:__ We are working on discourse parsing, coreference resolution, and automatic summarization, with a focus on long documents. We are also working on analyzing conversations (such as emails, [meetings](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/%7Ecarenini/PAPERS/birte2012-RashidCarenini.pdf), blogs, and chats), 
through topic segmentation, sentiment analysis, controversiality prediction, and conversational structure extraction. 

__Pragmatics and Commonsense Reasoning:__ We are working on acquiring and representing commonsense knowledge, developing reasoning modules, and incorporating commonsense into NLP models. 

__Natural Language Understanding:__ We are interested in tasks such as machine reading comprehension and natural language inference, in particular those involving reading between the lines. We are also working on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00087">interpreting figurative language</a>.

__Natural Language Generation:__ We are working on Text Structuring in text2text, data2text and image2text tasks. We are also interested in automatic evaluation of text generation models. 

__Text Analytics:__ We are working on tightly integrating interactive visualization with text mining and summarization techniques for information exploration and scalable decision support.
