###### Check out our work on extractive summarization for long documents!

We propose a novel neural single document extractive summarization model for long documents, incorporating both the global context of the whole document and the local context within the current topic.

Check out our [paper](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1298/) and [code](https://github.com/Wendy-Xiao/Extsumm_local_global_context).
